  <li>Version Control: Git</li>
  <li>Design: HTML5UP</li>
</ul>

## Optimizations
<p>In future optimizations, I am going to change the way the projects are displayed under "My Work"/"Latest Projects." I will also be including a dark mode that will change based on the user's computer settings.</p>

## Lessons Learned
<p>Customizing the template really showed me the nitty-gritty of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had to tweak the code to fit exactly what I wanted my site to look and act like & seamlessly incorporate new features with an existing codebase. It was very important to use Git for version control, especially when working with other engineers' code. The experience of working within the codebase boosted my problem-solving skills and critical thinking it takes to understand someone else's coding style.</p>
