## Description
Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of my recent projects, demonstrating my skills and expertise in building websites & web applications. From creating sleek and responsive websites to developing dynamic applications with API integrations, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions that meet user needs and exceed expectations. My portfolio includes projects, links to said projects & their GitHub repositories, and ways to get in contact with me.

<p>I used my intricate knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create my portfolio website by tailoring a template to exactly what I wanted to express: my projects, services, about me, and the ability to contact me.</p>

## Optimizations
<p>In future optimizations, I am going to change the way the projects are displayed under "My Work"/"Latest Projects." I will also be including a dark mode that will change based on the user's computer settings.</p>

## Lessons Learned
<p>Getting into customizing the template really showed me the nitty-gritty of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had to tweak the code to fit exactly what I wanted my site to look and act like & seamlessly incorporate new features. Then, using Git to handle all the changes and updates taught me how crucial it is to keep everything organized, especially when working with other engineers' code. The experience of working within the pre-existing template boosted my problem-solving skills and made me think more about how code interacts.</p>
